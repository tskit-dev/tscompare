    For two tree sequences `ts` and `other`, this method returns an object of
    type :class:`.ARFResult`.  The values reported summarize the degree to
    which nodes in `ts` "match" corresponding nodes in `other`.

    To match nodes, for each node in `ts`, the best matching node(s) from
    `other` has the longest matching span using :func:`.shared_node_spans`.
    If there are multiple matches with the same longest shared span
    for a single node, the best match is the match that is closest in time.
    This requires that the samples are the same in both tree sequences:
    in other words, if node `i` is a sample node in `ts`, then node `i` is
    also a sample node in `other` (and vice-versa).

    For each node in `other` we compute the inverse matched span
    as the maximum shared span amongst all nodes in `ts` for which that
    node is their best match.

    Then, :class:`.ARFResult` contains:

    - (`arf`)
        The fraction of the total span of `ts` over which each nodes'
        descendant sample set does not match its' best match's descendant
        sample set (i.e., the total *un*-matched span divided by the total
        span of `ts`).

    - (`tpr`)
        The proportion of the span in `other` that is correctly
        represented in `ts` (i.e., the total inverse matching span divided
        by the total span of `other`).

    - (`matched_span`)
        The total "matching" and "inverse matching" spans between `ts` and `other`.
        The "matching span" is the total span of all nodes in `ts` over which each
        node is ancestral to the same set of samples as its best match in `other`.
        The "inverse matching span" is the total span of all nodes in `other` over
        which each node is ancestral to the same set of sample as its best match in `ts`.

    - (`total_span`)
        The total node spans of `ts` and `other`.

    - (`rmse`)
        The root mean squared difference
        between the transformed times of the nodes in `ts`
        and transformed times of their best matching nodes in `other`,
        with the average weighted by the nodes' spans in `ts`.

    The callable `transform` is used to transform times before computing
    root-mean-squared error (see :class:`.ARFResult`); the default
    is `log(1 + t)`.

    :param ts: The focal tree sequence.
    :param other: The tree sequence we compare to.
