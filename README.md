Utilities for comparing Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs) represented as tree sequences. Provides tooling to quantify similarities and differences between ARG topologies, haplotype paths, and related structures. At present, this repository implements the methods described in
[Fritze et al., "A forest is more than its trees: haplotypes and ancestral recombination graphs"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.30.626138).
